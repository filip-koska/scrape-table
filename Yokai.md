### Short description:
Yokai is a type of ghost in Phasmophobia. It is sensitive to voices, and becomes more aggressive while players are speaking nearby, which allows it to start a hunt even at high sanity levels. At the same time, while it is hunting, the radius in which it can hear players is much smaller compared to the other ghost types.
